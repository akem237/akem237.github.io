Hi there! I am a researcher at the interface between data science and networking.
I aim to apply data science and artificial intelligence to help unleash the full potential of next-generation networks. 

I am a PhD student in the [Networks Data Science Group](https://networks.imdea.org/team/research-groups/networks-data-science-group/) at [IMDEA Networks Institute](https://networks.imdea.org/) in Madrid, Spain. 
I am also a student at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home), where I am enrolled in the [Telematics Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/phdprogram/telematic-engineering) program. 

Prior to my PhD studies, I completed an engineering degree at the University of Yaounde I, in Cameroon and a master's 
in electrical and computer engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University Africa](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/index.html), in Rwanda. There, my research was on machine learning for energy-saving optimization in cellular networks, with a conference paper published in [IEEE UEMCON 2020](https://ieee-uemcon.org/ieee-uemcon-2020/). 

I am currently involved with the [European Union's Horizon 2020 project "BANYAN"](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/860239) which aims to bring big data analytics to radio access networks. At the moment, I am visiting Ranplan Wireless and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom as 
part of the secondments of the project. Previously, I visited the SMART team at [Orange](https://www.orange.com/en) Innovation Networks for another secondment.
My current research interest is in the area of in-band network intelligence, with a focus on in-network machine learning. 
Recent research outputs are published in top conferences like [IEEE INFOCOM](https://infocom2024.ieee-infocom.org/).
