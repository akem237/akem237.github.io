Hi there! I am a researcher at the interface between machine learning and programmable networking.
I aim to apply these two concepts to help unleash the full potential of next-generation networks. 

<b>I am on the research job market. I am open to postdoctoral or industrial research positions.</b>

I am a final-year PhD student in the [Networks Data Science Group](https://networks.imdea.org/team/research-groups/networks-data-science-group/) at [IMDEA Networks Institute](https://networks.imdea.org/) in Madrid, Spain, headed by [Prof. Marco Fiore](https://networks.imdea.org/team/imdea-networks-team/people/marco-fiore/).
I am also a student at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Home), where I am enrolled in the [Telematics Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/phdprogram/telematic-engineering) program. 

My PhD project is part of the [European Union's Horizon 2020 project "BANYAN"](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/860239) which aims to bring big data analytics to radio access networks. During my PhD, I visited [Ranplan Wireless](https://www.ranplanwireless.com/gb/) and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom as 
part of the secondments of the EU project. I also visited the SMART team at [Orange](https://www.orange.com/en) Innovation Networks for another secondment.
My current research interest is in the area of in-band network intelligence, with a focus on in-network machine learning. 
Recent research outputs are published in top conferences like [IEEE INFOCOM](https://infocom2024.ieee-infocom.org/).

Prior to my PhD studies, I completed an engineering degree at the [University of Yaounde I](https://uy1.uninet.cm/), in Cameroon and a master's 
in electrical and computer engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University Africa](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/index.html), in Rwanda. There, my research was on machine learning for energy-saving optimization in cellular networks, with a conference paper published in [IEEE UEMCON 2020](https://ieee-uemcon.org/ieee-uemcon-2020/).
